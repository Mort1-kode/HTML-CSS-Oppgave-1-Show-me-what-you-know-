          <h2>About Planet Uranus</h2>

          <p class="paragraf_text">
            Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, and it's the third
            largest planet in our solar system – about four times wider than
            Earth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Uranus is a very cold and windy world. The ice giant is surrounded
            by 13 faint rings and 28 small moons. Uranus rotates at a nearly
            90-degree angle from the plane of its orbit. This unique tilt makes
            Uranus appear to spin sideways, orbiting the Sun like a rolling
            ball. Uranus was the first planet found with the aid of a telescope.
            It was discovered in 1781 by astronomer William Herschel, although
            he originally thought it was either a comet or a star. It was two
            years later that the object was universally accepted as a new
            planet, in part because of observations by astronomer Johann Elert
            Bode.

        <section id="Formation">
          <h2>Formation</h2>

          <p>
            Uranus took shape when the rest of the solar system formed about 4.5
            billion years ago – when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to
            become this ice giant. Like its neighbor Neptune, Uranus likely
            formed closer to the Sun and moved to the outer solar system about 4
            billion years ago, where it is the seventh planet from the Sun.

        <section id="Icy planet">
          <h2>Icy planet</h2>

          <p>
            Uranus is one of two ice giants in the outer solar system (the other
            is Neptune). Most (80% or more) of the planet's mass is made up of a
            hot dense fluid of "icy" materials – water, methane, and ammonia –
            above a small rocky core. Near the core, it heats up to 9,000
            degrees Fahrenheit (4,982 degrees Celsius).

        <section id="Surface">
          <h2>Surface</h2>

          <p>
            As an ice giant, Uranus doesn’t have a true surface. The planet is
            mostly swirling fluids. While a spacecraft would have nowhere to
            land on Uranus, it wouldn’t be able to fly through its atmosphere
            unscathed either. The extreme pressures and temperatures would
            destroy a metal spacecraft.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="Atmosphere">
          <h2>Atmosphere</h2>

          <p>
            Uranus' atmosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium, with a small
            amount of methane and traces of water and ammonia. The methane gives
            Uranus its signature blue color. Uranus' planetary atmosphere, with
            a minimum temperature of 49K (-224.2 degrees Celsius) makes it even
            colder than Neptune in some places. Wind speeds can reach up to 560
            miles per hour (900 kilometers per hour) on Uranus. Winds are
            retrograde at the equator, blowing in the reverse direction of the
            planet’s rotation. But closer to the poles, winds shift to a
            prograde direction, flowing with Uranus' rotation.

          <h2>Uranus Rings</h2>
          <p>
            Uranus has two sets of rings. The inner system of nine rings
            consists mostly of narrow, dark grey rings. There are two outer
            rings: the innermost one is reddish like dusty rings elsewhere in
            the solar system, and the outer ring is blue like Saturn's E ring.
            In order of increasing distance from the planet, the rings are
            called Zeta, 6, 5, 4, Alpha, Beta, Eta, Gamma, Delta, Lambda,
            Epsilon, Nu, and Mu. Some of the larger rings are surrounded by
            belts of fine dust. Featured Story
